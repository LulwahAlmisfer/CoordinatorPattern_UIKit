# CoordinatorPattern_UIKit
Learning coordinator design pattern

my notes📝 :

the coordinator pattern lets us decouple our view controllers so that each one has no idea what view controller came before or comes next.

now the view controller is not resposible about creating, configuring, and presenting another VCs.
